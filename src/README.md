## Test1:

Fix the bug:

1. Create 3 item: item1, item2, item3
2. Mark item1 as checked
3. Delete item3
4. item1 will be unchecked, it should keep be checked

## Test2:

Fix the counter.

Counter is running incorrectly: try to change the configs: size, step, interval.

## Test3:

1. Click Render button
2. Expected: The loading was showed, then after data was caclulated, hide the loading and fill data to activity board.

Note: change the `onRender` function only
